# Job-Finder
I have built a modern Job Finder Web Application using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. This platform allows users to search, explore, and apply for jobs with a smooth and responsive UI. It also includes authentication, dashboards, and SEO-optimized pages for real-world performance.
